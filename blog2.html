        <p><em style="font-size:110%;">This layout uses CSS Grid to make <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/breaking-out-with-css-grid-layout/">full-width elements</a> without using max-width on paragraphs, negative margins, or other common hacks.</em></p>

        <p>Great photos have power.</p>


        <p>Photo can boost sales, gather interest and tell stories.  Your Images can tell your viewers what your website is about before they’ve read a single sentence. Great product photos do more to sell merchandise than pages of text ever could.</p>

        <p>But you probably already know that.</p>

        <p>What you probably don’t know, is how to properly use images to make your website more effective.  Know that such a thing is possible, and actually executing it are two separate things.</p>

        <p>In this article, I’m going to show you how to get great photos, edit them, and make them work for you!</p>

                <p>This is my own implementation of a concept  from  <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/breaking-out-with-css-grid-layout/">Tyler Sticka</a>.</p>
                <p>I really like this concept, as it pulls off this layout without the usual hackery like crazy max-widths, negative margins, etc.</p>
                <p>However, it's not quite ready for production sites yet as it doesn't currently work in browsers that don't support CSS grid.</p>
